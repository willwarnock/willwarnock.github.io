    <h2 id="bathroom-supplies-wholesaler-and-retailer--cin7">Bathroom supplies wholesaler and retailer – Cin7</h2>
<p>Implemented Cin7 to manage stock, sales orders and purchase orders. Included Warehouse management system was not up to par with what we had been sold on (no returns function, limited information about products, no way to print packing slips, no way to print labels – natively from the WMS itself).
Built a custom dashboard using Python (flask) and the Cin7 API. Made API calls for Sales Orders, Purchase Orders and Credit Notes (returns), then displayed these on an HTML dashboard (bootstrap). This serves as one central location for the warehouse staff to view all orders sorted by chronological date – no need for changing menus or applying filters. Added a button to refresh the API call and access the Warehouse Management System for inwards/outwards goods. Added links to each Order so the warehouse staff can easily access documents for printing (packing slips) and barcode labels. The app launches on start-up and is accessed through the web browser (localhost).
Then implemented barcode system. Used advantages of WMS barcode reading and now equipped with the ability to print labels through custom dashboard. Every item in the warehouse now has a barcode. Recommended barcode scanner and label printer, facilitated testing. All invoices, packing slips and purchase orders also have barcodes to limit how much the warehouse workers are required to interact with the local computer.</p>
<h2 id="supplements-wholesaler--cin7">Supplements wholesaler – Cin7</h2>
<p>Shifted a supplements wholesaler from managing inventory through Xero to Cin7. The reason for this transition was so that we could get more accurate landed costs of inventory held, resulting in easier financing from the bank. This job required batch tracking with expiry dates as the products are perishable. We also had to integrate with a 3PL.
This also involved reconciling the stock on hand in the inventory system with what had been being tracked in the old system, Xero inventory. We discovered a big variance here that had to do with a few key transactions. After a detailed analysis of the Xero inventory reports, we collaborated with the accounts team to adjust the inventory levels in the accounts to match what we had on hand within Cin7.</p>
<h2 id="strengthened-concrete-manufacturer--simpro">Strengthened concrete manufacturer – simPRO</h2>
<p>No visibility of job-costing, could not see a breakdown of the cost of any given jobs. Required solution to manage as their scale continued to climb, tracking clients, project processes and most importantly the costs of individual jobs (for comparison etc.).
Facilitated the migration and conversion of accounting package from MYOB to Xero. Was responsible for Chart of Accounts, Contacts, Monthly Journals, Prior Year TB, Conversion Balance, Assets, Prior Period Transactions, Importing Debtors/Creditors and Back costing for jobs on the go.
Prepared configuration files for adopting simPRO. Suppliers, customers, employees and product catalogue. All formatted in CSV’s ready for upload to the software.
Implemented simPRO software, suitable for services, projects and maintenance workflows.
Problem solving to set up jobs accordingly and have them align with existing quoting and costing practices.
Provided on-site training to staff members of the organisation. Handled additional queries as they arose following implementation. This required a comprehensive understanding of the implemented system and problem-solving skills to find solutions in a timely manner.</p>
<h2 id="retailer--shopify">Retailer – Shopify</h2>
<p>Integrated Shopify buy buttons into existing Square Space website. This was the best option as existing site already had strong SEO, and did not want to damage it by converting the entire site over to Shopify.
Trained the client on the best way to manage inventory through the existing Xero inventory system to maintain consistency with the additional sales channel.
Client was happy with final product delivered. Gave him the ability to take orders over the weekend or after 5pm, and more time as he was not handling time-intensive process of receiving orders via email or over the phone.
Also aided in facilitating a business planning session, identifying various short-term and long-term goals that the business owner had for the venture. Was also exposed to hearing about the opportunities and vulnerabilities that are unique to the particular industry that this client worked in, and those factors that affected their business more or less than the rest of the industry.</p>
<h2 id="orthopaedic-surgeon--elixir-healthcare">Orthopaedic Surgeon – Elixir Healthcare</h2>
<p>Project managed the switching of an Orthopaedic surgeon to a new practice management software.  Elixir was the chosen application. I was then required to understand the software’s functionality, capabilities and shortfalls against the selection criteria that we worked with the client to decide on. Migrating the data from the old system was a pain-point of this project of which I took on the greatest responsibility. The old system had challenges of complex data compression in addition to the sheer volume of data that we needed to get out of it.
I was then responsible for getting the staff up to speed. This meant training the administrative manager on how to use the software on a daily basis, and providing basic training to the Surgeon for completing their day-to-day tasks in the software.
My ongoing work on this job after implementation mainly included refining the process of getting paid by ACC, which involved generating an invoice report out of Elixir and uploading it to ACC’s service.</p>
