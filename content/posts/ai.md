OpenAI is a San Francisco research company that has recently released two game-changing tools.
GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Both of these tools enable you to generate text responses based on given text prompts. A few examples:

```
Can you write an introduction for a manual about how to use GPT-3? The manual is for non-technical users

"Welcome to the world of GPT-3! This manual will guide you through the basics of using this powerful artificial intelligence tool. With GPT-3, you can generate human-like text, perform language translation, and even create original content. Whether you are a business owner, content creator, or simply someone looking to explore the capabilities of AI, this manual will provide you with the knowledge you need to get started. So let's dive in and learn how to use GPT-3 like a pro!"

What are the key takeaways from David Goggins' book? Write them into a conlusion for a book summary

David Goggins' book, "Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds" is an inspiring look at how to push past limits and strive for greatness. Through his own story of personal growth and resilience, Goggins shares valuable lessons on discipline, emotional intelligence, and the power of the mind. The key takeaways from this book are that you have the ability to control your own destiny, and that no matter what life throws your way, with the right mindset and perseverance you can achieve anything. Goggins encourages readers to embrace the discomfort of challenging themselves and to use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, ultimately leading to a life filled with greater purpose and fulfillment.

What's unique about these tools is that the generated text is unique'ish. The response comes from an enourmous pool of sources that the model has trained on and therefore provides you with an output that is a collection of those sources, not just one - making it different to a Google search. Another 'unique' element to the response is you can ask the model again for an answer, or tweak your prompt slightly, and the response output will change.

**How is this possible? (in simple terms)**
* Advanced AI technology (natural langauge processing, reinforcement learning and neural networks)
* An Enormous amount of pre-trained data
* Massive computational power (CPU and GPU intensive)

**Is it free?**  
As of writing this, ChatGPT is a free service. It is currently being offered for free because each input you enter is being used to provide feedback to the model and train it further. OpenAI offers a paid service that can be accessed via the ["Playground"](https://beta.openai.com/playground) or through an API. The current price for this is ~2 cents per 1,000 words.

**How are ChatGPT and GPT-3 different?**  
ChatGPT is a natural-language processing system that can be used to generate conversations with users. It uses a large language model to generate context-aware sentences and responses. GPT-3 is a larger and more powerful language model than chatGPT, which can be used to generate text, code, and other kinds of content. GPT-3 uses a neural network to generate high-quality text with minimal input, allowing it to create conversations, articles, and more.

ChatGPT is unable to search new information due to its reliance on a limited set of pre-trained data. This means that it can only answer questions based on the data it has already seen. This limitation can be a problem when trying to answer questions that require researching new information, as ChatGPT will not be able to do that. GPT3 playground enables users to provide their own data, which allows it to answer questions based on more personalised information. This allows for more accurate and relevant answers to questions that require researching new information, as the data is tailored specifically to the user.

Both tools can be used in the browser, making them convenient and accessible. However, GPT-3 Playground is best suited for testing and exploring language models, while ChatGTP is better for engaging in conversations with AI.

My general rule of thumb is to use ChatGPT until you get a response something along the lines of "I am a large language model trained by OpenAI and do not have access to external information or the ability to browse the internet". Try re-word your question, or switch over to GPT-3 Playground.

**What does AI think about it?**  
ChatGPT and GPT3 are powerful tools that can help you increase your productivity and reduce the amount of time you spend on tedious tasks. With ChatGPT and GPT3, you can quickly generate summaries of conversations and text documents without having to deal with the administrative aspects of writing. Additionally, you can use the natural language processing capabilities of GPT3 to generate more accurate summaries that accurately reflect the tone and meaning of conversations. With the help of ChatGPT and GPT3, you can save time and get more done in less time.[^extra links]
