Time and time again I've found myself caught in a tension between *being* busy and *looking* busy at work. The distinction sounds trivial, but for myself and fellow new members of the workforce, the concept of the strict 40-hour work week is perplexing and seems counter-intuitive.

My first discovery as a fresh graduate is that there are speed-limits at work. For the estranged minority like myself that actually like working and take satisfaction in getting things done, this was painful to figure out. For my extra hours, attention and effort I've been repeatedly rewarded with mind numbing busy-work, the task of finding more work for myself or meaningless training - all in the name of management keeping me busy at my desk. So what's the logical behavioural response to this incentive structure? Slow-down... Parkinson's law could not be more true than in the workplace. 

```
Parkinson's Law
"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

My next finding as a working professional is every hour I work is not equal. Some days it's really easy to fully immerse myself in a task or problem, whereas on others it feels like I'm hitting my head against a wall repeatedly. As much as work-life balance helps to increase my baseline "motivation", there's undoubtedly still some inconsistencies of being more or less motivated at a day-to-day level. In addition, after working continuous days or weeks fully immersed tackling an issue, I need time to recover so it should be expected that my effort will fall below average - but this is offset my the above average performance of the previous week. 

Yet, my employer has imposed that my *productivity* is fixed at 8 hours per day. 

I've conceptualised this daily "motivation" level  



Why does the work schedule not accommodate for this? When I'm facing a substantial, non-urgent task after having worked all morning on another issue, I know that *I will not* get a good return for the time I spend on that issue. The absolute best thing I could do to tackle the new task is to focus my attention to something light, or take a break. But rather, because I have to fill my timesheet I'll spend hours on something I know I will scrap as soon as I look at it with fresh eyes. And overall, what would've taken just a couple hours the next day will have the added 'dead' hours from the previous day as I tried to tackle the problem in a mentally exhausted state. 



Whether this inconsistent motivation is an attitude problem, 

I liken this to running, some days it's effortless and others you're battling, but make no mistake I'll be pushing myself further and harder on those days when it feels effortless. 

where one day a short run feels so effortless, yet going for that same run the next week feels like a constant battle. You can't explain why 


 Working too fast is punished with being assigned busy-work, having to find more work yourself, or looking busy in the office. What if the speed limits were taken off? If I get assigned X tasks that took the last employee Y hours to complete, if I finish them faster than Y, can I have freedom back in my day?


incentives, human nature and office culture make it very clear that there are two types of "busy".

## Incentives


## Human nature

## Office culture
Somehow within offices we've all come to police each others' arriving and leaving times. Why?  

The 40-hour work week works brilliantly for some, but for others like myself and a growing group of people that I've spoken to, it doesn't. 

I'm beginning to start sounding like a broken record repeating these ideas with my mates so I've formally written down what's in my head here. 

When I engage in an employee contract, let's be clear on whether I'm being paid to show up to the office for 40 hours a week, or to complete tasks. Employers can't have it both ways. 



What I mean by this is that because everyhing at my workplace (professional services; accounting/consulting) comes down to hours

What makes a 'Good' employee?
I think if you posed this question to any manager they would tell you that all it takes to be a good employee is to get the job done, on time and to a high-standard. Simple right? But how is this tracked? Within accounting and consulting the metric we've picked to measure this is hours. 

Office culture
After a long enough time at

What if we just did the work that was asked of us, and 
WFH gives some of this freedom back. From a middle-manager's perspective, all of the work that was being completed

Think about the reward structures for a moment. If I am tasked with a job that took the last person **5** hours to do and I finish it in **2** hours what happens?
